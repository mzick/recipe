# RecipeApp

This project was part of a training course on building a Recipe display to include ingredients, shopping list and other components in order to demonstrate features of Angular 13. 

1. data binding
2. creation of components, directives, services
3. directives
4. 2 way binding

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.0.

## Set up notes

Don't download the NodeJS version 17 - it doesn't work with angular.

Use LTS version of Node from https://nodejs.org/en/download

I ran `npm i -g @angular/cli@13.0.4` and created a new project with `ng new`

For the UX, bootstrap3 was used - `npm install --save bootstrap3`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
